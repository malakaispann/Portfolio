## Objective

The objective of this project was to develop a website to showcase some of the other things I've built.

Built with React and TypeScript in 2023.

## Use

This project is not intended to be used as a template or guide, but it can definitely can be used as "inspiration." Please link back to this repo or [MalakaiSpann.com](https://malakaispann.com) if you do.

### Installation

Developed, built, and deployed using `Node v22`

```bash
cd client
bun install
```

### Building and Testing

Test the app using a server on your machine

```bash
cd client
bun start
```

Generating a production build

```bash
cd client
bun run build
```

I used [Vercel](https://www.Vercel.com) to serve the app. If you want to view the production build on a local server you can use something like [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve).

## Inspirations

While making the site, I looked to these great sites for design ideas:

-   [Maverick a.k.a SupaCode's Portfolio](https://www.supacode.dev)
-   [Olaolu Olawuyi's Portfolio](https://olaolu.dev/)
-   [V4 of Brittany Chiang's Portfolio](https://v4.brittanychiang.com/)
-   [Diogo Correia's Portfolio](https://diogotc.com/)
-   [Akshay's Portfolio](https://aksh-ai.com/)

Go checkout these talented devs!

Friendly reminder: don't be a weirdo who steals source code. Even when credited, it's still pretty shady to straight copy someone else's work. The occasional peak when you're stuck is fine, but learn how to do it yourself... it'll get you much farther!

## Future Plans

1. Currently, the site only showcases highlight projects. I plan on developing a mechanism to showcase the less prominent projects.

Any major changes other than the one(s) above won't be happening in this site. I'm too busy building other cool stuff. I might create a new version though.

See my [personal thoughts and takeaways](./Final_Thoughts.md) from this project.

Thanks,
